      "Instruction": "The dish is quite spicy, mango chutney helps cool but this is still really hot! It leaves an afterburn on the tongue that doesnâ€™t disappear right away. The tandoori chicken is noticeably aromatic when cooking, the house smelled like tandoori chicken for about a day and a half after cooking this."
